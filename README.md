# MusicLibraryApp-Android
A music library app with a simple and uncomplicated UI. Plays music(.mp3) files and has all the essential features you need in a Music Player! 

Has a simple Playback bar with Start/Stop button and shows the duration of the file played. Will add the Rename, Delete and Share options as in the MP4Player app here! https://github.com/parthnan/MP4Player-Android

# Challenges Overcame
Using and debugging Multithreading to handle the logic of the Playback bar and associated events(drag,pause,reset progress etc.) was a hurdle. Unlike video related apps, the logic behind the Playback UI is not provided by Music related libraries.
